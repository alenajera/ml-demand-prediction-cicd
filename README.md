# Project: Demand Prediction Model with Automated CI/CD Deployment

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **complete MLOps workflow**, including:

- Training a **Machine Learning model** to predict **weekly product demand**.
- Exposing the model as a **REST API using Flask**.
- **Containerization with Docker** and automated deployment using **Kubernetes**.
- **CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins** for automated model training, image building, and deployment.

ðŸ’¼ **Skills Demonstrated:**
- Machine Learning applied to demand forecasting and time series.
- MLOps and DevOps (CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins).
- Cloud-ready pipeline design for production environments.
